## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes
- Added "Move Activity" button to both table view and card view edit activity modals
- Created move activity modal with day selection and automatic date display
- Added beautiful themed custom confirmation modal for user safety
- Implemented client-side validation
- Added CSS styling for the move modal and confirmation modal with date display
- Created separate functions for table view and card view move operations
- Automatic date calculation based on selected day (Day 1 = Sept 25, 2025)

### Backend Changes
- Created new `/api/itinerary/move` endpoint
- Handles moving activities between Google Sheets
- Preserves all activity data including images, notes, and links
- Implements proper error handling and rate limiting
- Invalidates cache for both source and target days

### Data Flow
1. User selects activity to move
2. Frontend sends move request to backend
3. Backend adds activity to target day sheet
4. Backend deletes activity from source day sheet
5. Cache is invalidated for both days
6. Frontend refreshes to show updated itinerary

## Error Handling
- Validates that source and target days are different
- Ensures all required fields are provided
- Handles Google Sheets API rate limiting
- Provides user-friendly error messages
- Graceful fallback if operations fail

## Security
- Requires authentication and edit permissions
- Validates user permissions before allowing move operations
- Sanitizes input data
- Maintains audit trail through logging

## Notes
- The move operation is atomic - if either the add or delete operation fails, the entire move is rolled back
- All activity data (time, description, notes, cost, link, image) is preserved during the move
- The activity will be set to visible by default in the new location
- The feature works with the existing Google Sheets structure
